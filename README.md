# Virtual_Closet
An App to build out your own virtual closet and have an outfit picked for you from your clothes based on the current weather forecast. Uses mySQL, Express, Materialize, Handlebars, and a clientside handlebars function named BrowserBars.
I plan to utilize the website to allow users to search and try on clothes based on their most shopped brands without leaving their home. The website will also have a seasonal feature to it that will allow people to post their ideas based on the seasons and help inspire others.
